# AI Site MVP Frontend

An interactive web application that generates websites using AI and allows real-time modifications through an AI chat assistant.

## Features

### ðŸŽ¨ AI-Powered Website Generation

- Generate complete websites from natural language descriptions
- Real-time code editor with syntax highlighting
- Live preview of generated websites
- Download generated HTML files

### ðŸ’¬ Interactive AI Assistant

- Chat sidebar for follow-up modifications
- Context-aware conversations that remember previous changes
- Real-time code patching and updates
- Visual feedback showing what changes were made

### ðŸ”§ Code Modification Examples

The AI assistant can handle requests like:

- "Make the footer sticky"
- "Add a hero image"
- "Change the color scheme to blue"
- "Add a contact form"
- "Make the navigation responsive"
- "Add animations to the buttons"

## How It Works

1. **Initial Generation**: Enter a description of the website you want to create
2. **Code Editing**: The generated code appears in the Monaco editor with live preview
3. **AI Modifications**: Use the chat sidebar to request changes to your website
4. **Context Tracking**: The AI remembers your conversation and previous changes
5. **Real-time Updates**: Changes are applied immediately to both editor and preview

## Technical Implementation

### Conversation Context

- Tracks conversation history between user and AI
- Maintains current code state
- Sends diff/patch information to API for context-aware responses

### Code Change Tracking

- Uses diff algorithm to track line-by-line changes
- Generates unified diff patches
- Provides human-readable change summaries
- Visual indicators for additions, modifications, and deletions

### Architecture

- **Angular 17** with standalone components
- **Monaco Editor** for code editing
- **RxJS** for reactive state management
- **HTTP Client** for API communication

## API Endpoints

### `/api/generate`

  }
}
```

**Response:**

```json
{
